# Flutter 3D Lorenz Attractor

This is a Flutter application that draws a 3D visualization of the Lorenz Attractor. The visualization is created using custom painting and 3D transformations.

The code consists of a `HomeScreen` widget that calculates the Lorenz Attractor's points and passes them to a `CustomPainter`. The `CustomPainter` then draws the points as a series of connected lines using 3D transformations to create a 3D effect.

## Requirements

3. Run the app

## Usage

Once the app is running, the Lorenz Attractor visualization will be displayed on the screen. The visualization will continue to update and change over time as the Lorenz Attractor is calculated.
